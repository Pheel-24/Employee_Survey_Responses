This greatly influenced the overall responses to the questions posed during the survey with 765 of the 1,989 (about 38.5%) responses agreeing to question 9 and 996 of the 3,384 (about 29.4%) responses strongly agreeing to question 1. Also having 310 of the 938 (about 33%) responses disagreeing to question 6.

3. As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

Since it can be observed that most of the employees disagree with question 6 _I have a best friend at work_ and strongly disagree with question 3 _In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work_, the following steps should be taken to improve the employees satisfaction;

• Team building activities should be encouraged to improve interpersonal relationships between employees in various departments.

• Good communication which involves active listening, communicating clearly and concisely and constructive feedback should be greatly encouraged.

• Creating a positive work environment where everyone feels included, valued, recognized and appreciate the effort of their colleagues.

•	Creation of informal gathering such as lunch or coffee breaks, end of year or Christmas party to create opportunity for informal interactions.

•	Create appreciation avenues like ‘employee of the month’ to appreciate employees for their good work.

•	After the completion of a project, employees should be properly appreciated for their good work either verbally or by giving gifts.
